#+TITLE: kanji-glasses-mode
#+STARTUP: indent

Provides a minor mode for displaying the hiragana reading alongside
kanji present in a buffer. This is accomplished using overlays, so the
contents of the buffer are not modified at all.

Enabling this mode will take some time on a buffer with a lot of kanji
present. To combat this, I've memoized the transliteration method, so
it at least won't look up the same thing more than once.

Currently relies on [[https://github.com/wsgac/kanji-mode][kanji-mode]] for its =km:kanji->hiragana= method
(which in turn relies on having [[http://kakasi.namazu.org/][kakasi]] installed) to transliterate
kanji to hiragana.
